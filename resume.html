            <div>
                <p>After leaving employment at Black River, I was hired for Johnston County Public Schools. In order to begin work, I took a Substitute Teacher Training Course and attended 30 hours of in-class training. I mostly worked at the same highschool that I graduated from in 2013. The work taught me more about working with those who are learning as well as collaborating with the other instructors.</p>
