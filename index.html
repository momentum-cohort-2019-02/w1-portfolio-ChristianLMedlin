        <h1> Christian Medlin</h1>
        <h2> Software Engineering Student</h2>
        <p> I've always enjoyed working with computers. I build my first desktop PC when I was in high school and have helped many of my friends and acquaintance when they are having issues with their hardware. I love learning about the world around me and figuring out how things work. My first experience in programming was in high school, I took a web development course as an elective, but I found the content far too underwhelming and basic. I started working with Javascript on my own and later transitioned into Python. I'm a highly competitive person. For years I competed in tournaments and rankings for the popular MOBA game Smite. I was able to attain the rank of Grandmaster, which is only available to those in the top 25 of the several millions of Smite players. I've since retired from Smite and am now focusing that same competitive energy towards making myself as successful as possible, and I'm using my intuition towards technology to make that happen.</p>
